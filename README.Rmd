Welcome to INCLUDE. This repository will serve as a guide for developing
shiny applications and contains the most basic golem shiny application
structure.  Here were the steps that went into creating this repository.

1. Create Golem Shiny App: `golem::create_golem()` as documented [here](https://engineering-shiny.org/setting-up-for-success.html#create-a-golem)
1. Create readme: `devtools::build_readme()`


## Installation

You can install the released version of includeshinytemplate from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("includeshinytemplate")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("include-dcc/include-shiny-template")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(includeshinytemplate)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
